  title: "Meningitis B Vaccination Clinic (Bexsero)",
  subtitle:
    "Comprehensive protection against invasive Meningococcal B bacteria for infants, teenagers, university students, and high-risk travellers.",
  category: "private" as const,
  fundingBadge: "Private Clinical Service",
  overview:
    "Meningococcal group B (MenB) is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning) in the United Kingdom. MenB disease is life-threatening and progresses rapidly within 24 hours, presenting with high fever, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, confusion, and a non-blanching purpuric rash. Vaccination with Bexsero stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against MenB surface proteins, providing proven clinical protection.",
  clinicalImportance:
    "While the NHS routine childhood immunisation programme covers MenB for infants born after May 2015, older children, teenagers, and young adults entering university or communal living are at elevated risk of contracting MenB and are not routinely covered by NHS programmes. Our private clinical service bridges this vital protection gap under accredited Patient Group Directions (PGD).",
  whoIsEligible: [
    "Infants and toddlers from 8 weeks of age not covered by routine NHS scheduling",
    "Adolescents and young adults (ages 14 to 25), particularly new university students in shared halls of residence",

    {
      question: "Why is the MenB vaccine recommended for university students?",
      answer:
        "University freshers living in shared accommodation, colleges, and university halls are at significantly increased risk of meningococcal transmission due to close contact, social mixing, and respiratory droplet spread. Vaccination ensures robust immunity against both meningitis and meningococcal sepsis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can MenB be administered alongside other vaccines?",
      answer:
        "Yes, Bexsero can be safely administered alongside most routine vaccines, including MenACWY, HPV, and seasonal influenza, provided separate injection sites are used.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any side effects?",
      answer:
        "Common reactions include mild soreness or redness at the injection site, transient low-grade fever, irritability in infants, and mild headache or fatigue in adults. These typically resolve within 24 to 48 hours.",
