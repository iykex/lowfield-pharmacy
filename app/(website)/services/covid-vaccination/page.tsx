  overview:
    "COVID-19 continues to circulate and evolve across the UK, causing increased rates of severe respiratory illness and hospital admissions among older adults and immunocompromised individuals during colder months. The NHS seasonal booster program utilizes updated mRNA variant vaccines specifically formulated to enhance neutralising antibody titers against emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.",

  whoIsEligible: [
    "All adults aged 65 and older",
    "Residents in a care home for older adults",
    "Individuals aged 6 months to 64 years with defined clinical vulnerabilities (e.g. chronic heart, kidney, liver, respiratory disease, immunosuppression)",
    "Frontline health and social care workers",
    "Individuals living with someone who has a weakened immune system",
  ],
  pricingNotes:
    "100% Free of charge for all eligible cohorts under the NHS England seasonal vaccination programme.",
  whatToExpect: [
    "Check-in and NHS cohort verification with the dispensary team.",
    "Pre-injection clinical questions regarding recent illnesses or adverse reactions.",

      question: "Can I receive the booster if I recently had COVID-19?",
